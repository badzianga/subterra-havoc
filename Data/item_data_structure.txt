PLANNED STRUCTURE OF ITEM DATA:

{
	UniqueItemID: {
		"Name": string,
		"Category": string (preferably enum later),
		"StackSize": int,
		"Description": string,
		"FileName": string,
	}
}

Additional fields should be added to special items, such as damage, cooldown, added health, etc.
Each item will probably contain two file paths - to the icon and to the item in the world.

Special effects of the weapons - strategy design pattern?
Effects may be stored in the structure as path to the class, this class could be loaded as
child node and added to the weapon
